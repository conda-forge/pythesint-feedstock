  summary: 'An interface to metadata vocabularies for geospatial and other geophysical data'

  description: |
    pythesint provides access to controled vocabularies following
    the standards defined at NASA's Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)
    (http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov) and the NetCDF-CF conventions
    (http://cfconventions.org/), plus possibly others that will be added as
    needs emerge. The standards are mapped in Python dictionaries and saved
    to json-files.
